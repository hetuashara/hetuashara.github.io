I bravely tested the murky waters of fake likes and subscribers on instagram for half an hour. I thought this to be a good way to test out Medium and recounted the ordeal over at Medium, [click here](https://medium.com/@asharahetu/instagram-fakes-39c133f1d631) to read it.  
  
I am a strong opposer of centralised mediums for publishing, and that is/was my prime motivation for creating this website. But I wanted to taste the grass on the other side.   
  
Here are the things I liked and disliked about writing one article on Medium.  

__Liked__ :  
- The ease with which images can be inserted, captioned, and emphasized at 3 different zoom levels is refreshingly easy and encouraging. The tedious procedure of uploading the images to the relevant folder, jumping back to markdown editor, and then typing out the link in plain text form for this Jekyll based website is no fun.  
- No need to save, commit, and push changes. Drafts get autosaved in the browser and I hit the Publish button whenever I am ready. So convenient.     
 
__Disliked__ :  
- Writing on a website not owned and operated by me.  
- No markdown.  
- No footnotes.    
- Inability to customise looks.  
    

I won't be switching over to Medium any time soon.
