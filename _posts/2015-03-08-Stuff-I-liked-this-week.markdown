This was a busy week -  midterms, binge watch of House of Cards s03 and yet another World Cup match of India. Good articles flew by my RSS and twitter timeline but all I could do was sweep them off into Pinboard or Pocket. Looks like next week's list will be a big one. Enjoy reading(?) this short collection of couple of comics and tweets.       

If you want more stuff to check out, you can always go back to the [last weeks' collections](http://hetus.net/Stuff-I-Liked-This-Week.html).

- House of Cards season 3 - Not as captivating as the first two seasons but still a great watch. I finished first two seasons in one session each. The third one took two. So, there's that.
