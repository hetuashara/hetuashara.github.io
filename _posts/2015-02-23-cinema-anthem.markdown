![fake patriotism](http://hetus.net/images/na-cinema.jpg)    

Last time I saw a movie was in December 2014. Two movies in a week. National anthem was played before each of them.   
As soon as the message displayed on screen telling audience to get up for the anthem, an involuntary sigh came out of me, both times.   
Not because I don't like the anthem, or because I am not a patriot.   
But because it is plain stupid to have national anthem play before each movie. All it does is create a fake sense of patriotism.   
What did you do for your country this month? I stood up for national anthem in a dark cinema hall.
