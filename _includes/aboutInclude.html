<p>This is my personal website, a weblog if you will. I write whatever catches my eye, is on my mind, fancies me, tickles my fancy â€¦ you get the point. Anything. </p>

<p>But generally the topics will revolve around <em>Technology</em>, <em>Photography</em> and <em>Travel</em>. </p>

<p>The category of <strong>Tech</strong> is a huge umbrella. I consider anything that makes human life better as technology. Fire is technology, but just not as young as say computers. The 21st century has captured the term and dedicated it to the field of computers. But not me. </p>

<p>As far as <strong>photography</strong> is concerned, as you can see from my photography hardware I am not a professional photographer but sure would like to become one. Some day.</p>

<p>I love <strong>traveling</strong>. Every aspect of it. Different foods, people, culture, weather, vibes. So much to take in. I am always looking for opportunities to be on the road. If you know of an opportunity, do let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Anything</strong>: I am a voracious reader. I read a lot. That makes me wanna think about a lot of topics. And this place is for me to streamline my thoughts and present it to myself and others.<br/></p>

<p>Oh yes. And I also draw <strong>comics</strong>. I am an extremely poor drawer so all the living beings are stick figures, all the lines are slant and skewed, and circles odd shaped ovals. But the message of the comic is important, right? Right.</p>
