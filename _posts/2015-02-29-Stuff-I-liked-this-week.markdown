#Stuff to read 
- [between the bars on Twitter: "Victim sets fire to her rapist. Tumblr users reply with how people reply to rape cases."](https://twitter.com/standbythebody/status/561091730775486464/photo/1)  
- [My Boyfriend Loves Fat Women](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinchirico/my-boyfriend-loves-fat-women)  
- [It is expected that passive voice will continue to annoy me](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2015/2/24/passive-voice)
#Stuff to watch
- [Benedict Cumberbatch photo shoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7QXXrCx-G0) - And we wonder why our random iPhone portrait shots don't turn out as good as the ones in magazines.  
- [Finding Love After a Heart Transplant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evzw1QzzGg8)
#Stuff to listen  
- [Just press send](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=5631)  
- [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3652#comic)    
- [A simple guide to washing machine symbols](https://twitter.com/TechnicallyRon/status/570965607971209216/photo/1)
- [This is bigger than winning a lottery.](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/02/27/2120422/meet-the-man-who-could-own-aviva-france/) - It is like winning a lottery every week. This guy can invest with hindsight, a wish every investor in the world wishes more. Read the article to find out how it came to be a reality for this 25 year old. Hint: It has to do with short sightedness of big finance corporations.  
- [Picasso, Paula Scher, and the lifetime behind every second](https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/picasso_paula_scher_and_the_lifetime_behind_every_second.php) - It is not the time spent to complete a task but the end result that is of value. Don't miss out the anonymous (probably made up) anecdote in the first comment below the article text.  
- [Google, Our Patron Saint of the Closed Web](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/google-our-patron-saint-of-the-closed-web/) - Add yet one more thing that makes Google evil. This time the sneaky company has invaded the domain names, something that I perceived to be open up until now and blazing symbols of the free web. This week we achieved net neutrality, now it is time to fight this little known, but huge, thing.  
- [Parents find daughter 17 years after kidnap](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150227_ap_8fed300cc8b74384a5a7461a2fd63a2b.html?c=r) - Miracles do happen.  
- [Yes to the Dress?](https://medium.com/message/yes-to-the-dress-5ec06c06aca4) - So the dress thing blew up like crazy this week. If you read one article regarding it, let this article be the one you read. There is a lot of insights in there.  
- [Always bet on text](http://graydon.livejournal.com/196162.html) - I have always found text to be extremely malleable. The article has worthy points of its own.
