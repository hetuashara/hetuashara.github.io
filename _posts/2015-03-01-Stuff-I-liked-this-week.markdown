# Stuff to read 
- [Google, Our Patron Saint of the Closed Web](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/google-our-patron-saint-of-the-closed-web/) - Add yet one more thing that makes Google evil. This time the sneaky company has invaded the domain names, something that I perceived to be open up until now and blazing symbols of the free web. This week we achieved net neutrality, now it is time to fight this little known, but huge, thing.        
- [Picasso, Paula Scher, and the lifetime behind every second](https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/picasso_paula_scher_and_the_lifetime_behind_every_second.php) - It is not the time spent to complete a task but the end result that is of value. Don't miss out the anonymous (probably made up) anecdote in the first comment below the article text.
- [This is bigger than winning a lottery](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/02/27/2120422/meet-the-man-who-could-own-aviva-france/) - It is like winning a lottery every week. This guy can invest with hindsight, a wish every investor in the world wishes for. Read the article to find out how it came to be a reality for this 25 year old. Hint: It has to do with short sightedness of a big corporation.  
- [Yes to the Dress?](https://medium.com/message/yes-to-the-dress-5ec06c06aca4) - So the dress thing blew up like crazy this week. If you read one article regarding it, let this article be the one you read. There is a lot of insights in there.   
- [Always bet on text](http://graydon.livejournal.com/196162.html) - I have always found text to be extremely malleable. The article has excellent points of its own.  
- [The Paradox of Empathy](http://jenson.org/paradox/) - The author talks primarily design related empathy but I would stretch his writings to almost everything in life.    
- [Ethics](http://inessential.com/2015/02/26/ethics) - It is high time we embrace a system similar to one proposed here.    
- [My Boyfriend Loves Fat Women](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinchirico/my-boyfriend-loves-fat-women) - Apparently, fat people have it tough especially when their significant others like fat people.
- [It is expected that passive voice will continue to annoy me](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2015/2/24/passive-voice) - Avoid passive voice. 
- [Just press send](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=5631) - We are getting too reliable on AI (or at least the lowest levels of AI) for simple tasks. The recent autocomplete fails in gmail made us realise how much.
- [Parents find daughter 17 years after kidnap](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150227_ap_8fed300cc8b74384a5a7461a2fd63a2b.html?c=r) - Miracles do happen.     
- [Victim sets fire to her rapist. Tumblr users reply with how people reply to rape cases.](https://twitter.com/standbythebody/status/561091730775486464/photo/1)  
- [Apology cards sorted by discipline](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3652#comic) - A SMBC comic.   
- [A simple guide to washing machine symbols](https://twitter.com/TechnicallyRon/status/570965607971209216/photo/1) - I too have always found those little symbols confusing. But not this confusing.
- [I switched to a Standing Desk, so now you should, Too](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/switched-standing-desk-now) - I have never laughed out loud so loudly, so many times while reading text, at least in 2015.

# Stuff to watch
- [Benedict Cumberbatch photo shoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7QXXrCx-G0) - And we wonder why our random iPhone portrait shots don't turn out as good as the ones in magazines.  
- [Finding Love After a Heart Transplant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evzw1QzzGg8)  
- [V for Varoufakis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afl9WFGJE0M#action=share) - A comedic video that describes(mocks) the Greek finance minister.
