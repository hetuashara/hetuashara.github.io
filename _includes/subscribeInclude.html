	<p>If you would like to read what I write/draw and would <strong>not</strong> like to miss out, you can choose either of the following routes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BlogOfHetuAshara">RSS feed </a> - This is my favourite way to follow sites I like. No advertisements. No need to bookmark. No need to remember urls. No need to remember to go and visit website every day/week. Just add <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BlogOfHetuAshara">RSS feed </a>in your RSS reader of your choice and you are all set to receive the goodness.</li>
	<li>Twitter handle - If you religiously complete your twitter timeline then you can <a href="https://twitter.com/hetuashara">follow me (@hetuashara) on twitter</a>. I will be tweeting links to new posts as soon as they are posted on the blog.</li>
	<li>Facebook - No facebook. Facebook asks for money to reach people. That makes me hate Facebook. You should too.</li>
	<li>Email subscribe - You can subscribe to receive new posts in your inbox by <a href="http://eepurl.com/beT0CL">clicking here</a>.</li>
	<li>Setting alarm to check the website everyday for new posts - not highly recommended. But I will highly appreciate it if you would do this. </li>
</ul>
