#Stuff to read 
- [False Dichotomies](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2015/03/07/false_dichotomies/) - Always try to take a step back and judge the situation through a holistic lens.         
- [How WWI made wristwatches happen](http://boingboing.net/2015/03/04/how-wwi-made-wristwatches-happ.html) - Add one more thing to the long list of gifts from wars.  
- [Google Search Results, 2015 Edition](https://thomasborowski.de/2015/03/google-search-results-2015-edition/) - Apparently, Google has been promoting social media competitors. I have noticed this too.   
- [Back To The Blog](https://thomasborowski.de/2015/03/back-to-the-blog/) - Good to see people realising how truly insidious social media has become.  
- [No Time](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/no-time) - One of the rare(only?) times that I have read about someone from the past(1928 in this case) predict about the most important thing in life - time. Although, the prediction turned out to be completely wrong but the idea is fascinating, utopian one might say.  
- Polyphasic Sleep Adventure: [week 1](https://medium.com/@brian_lovin/my-polyphasic-sleep-adventure-week-1-f74e9b9bead2), [week 2](https://medium.com/@brian_lovin/my-polyphasic-sleep-adventure-week-2-cb4d860d5bb4), and [closing thoughts](https://medium.com/@brian_lovin/closing-thoughts-on-a-polyphasic-adventure-2e1b784f13fa) - Brian Lovin experimented with trying to sleep 4 hours per day. Stories like this always get me excited at attempting sleep hacking and reducing the time hog. But then I read follow-up story of a gradual crash and burn and stop myself. And also there is the fact that anything less than 8 hours a day and the next day I am stretching my sleep to at least 12 hours.  
- [10 Timeframes](https://medium.com/fords-sensorium/10-timeframes-383ffb56218f) - It is amazing how time can be viewed and perceived in various ways.
- [This just in: humans are bad at everything that’s important](http://www.raptitude.com/2015/03/this-just-in-humans-are-bad-at-everything-thats-important) - So many insights, nice one liners, and reflections on society. Underlying message is a one to adapt - give others leeway to make a mistake.    
- [The confidence conundrum](http://markmanson.net/confidence) - Every sentence in this article is worth pondering and remembering. Here are a couple I couldn't resist quoting: "our confidence is rooted in our perception of ourselves regardless of any tangible external reality." "The big charade with confidence is that it has nothing to do with the comfort of what we achieve and everything to do with the comfort of what we don’t achieve."    
- [“Platform” risk](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2015/3/14/platform-risk) - In the wake of Twitter (sort of) cutting off Meerkat's access to its graph, this article nicely shows how different business models create different types of platforms.  
- [Ikea](http://fortune.com/ikea-world-domination/) - Fascinating to read about the amount of research that goes behind the scenes at Ikea. Also, worth noting is the fact that market has rewarded Ikea for adapting to respect customers' habits, activities and demands.     
- [Inside the post-minecraft life of billionaire gamer god Markus Persson](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/03/03/minecraft-markus-persson-life-after-microsoft-sale/)  
- [Why BuzzFeed is the most important news organization in the world](http://stratechery.com/2015/buzzfeed-important-news-organization-world/)
     

#Stuff to watch
- [Still NYC](https://vimeo.com/121450839) - Great concept for street videography.  
- [The Comma Queen: Series Première](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-comma-queen-series-premiere) - I love English grammar, especially the nit-picky details. I think this is going to be a must-watch series.  
- [The first 360-degree interactive videos have arrived on Youtube](http://petapixel.com/2015/03/13/the-first-360-degree-interactive-videos-have-arrived-on-youtube/)
