In this era of considerably high RAM machines, the only people who spread their articles, especially text ones, across multiple pages are the ones who want to collect view-based-ad-revenue.   
If you have a modicum of respect for the work you have created and want to show it to the world, make it easy to consume, make it scrollable.
